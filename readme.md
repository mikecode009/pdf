# html-to-pdf-puppeteer

Its has always been a challenge for many developers to generate PDF from html on server side.
There are scenarios like where we need to generate a PDF invoice for a customer, save it on server as well as email them the PDF.

I am using a simple HTML invoice template to demonstrate how we can use puppeteer and node js to create a pdf of it on server.

**STEPS TO RUN ABOVE CODE**

 - First clone the repository using `git clone command`
 - Run `npm install` in the project root directory.
 - Wait for dependencies to install, they may take some time depending on your internet speed.
 - Run `node index.js` command in your terminal.

### You will see a file name invoice.pdf in you project root folder, that is the converted file from html to pdf.
